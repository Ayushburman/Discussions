How to Improve this Python Code ? 
Question:
Hello everyone,

I am currently reviewing the following Python code used to calculate the sum of a list of integers:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = 0

for i in range(len(numbers)):
    total = total + numbers[i]

print("Sum:", total)


While the code functions correctly, I am interested in improving its readability, maintainability, and overall efficiency.

Could you please suggest best practices or alternative approaches that would make this implementation more idiomatic and aligned with modern Python standards?

Thank you for your time and guidance.
